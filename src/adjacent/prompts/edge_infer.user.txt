Infer recommendation edges between the anchor product and the candidate products.

Anchor product (JSON):
{ANCHOR_JSON}

Candidate products (JSON array):
{CANDIDATES_JSON}

Constraints:
- Anchor↔candidate edges AND candidate↔candidate edges are allowed.
- Use only product IDs provided above.
- Canonical ordering: from_id <= to_id.
- Only include an edge if it is strongly justified by the text (title/description/category/tags/brand/price when present).

Now produce the structured output.
